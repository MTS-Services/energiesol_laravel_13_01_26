I have added the "Features" and "Services" links to the sidebar in `resources/js/layouts/partials/user/sidebar.tsx`.

You will need to run `npm run build` or `npm run dev` to see these changes reflected in your browser.

Please let me know if you'd like to use different icons for "Features" and "Services", or if you intended a nested navigation structure.
